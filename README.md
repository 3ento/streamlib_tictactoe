# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI opponents
### Made with Streamlit

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe application with 3 levels of computer opponents-Easy, Medium and Hard:
- Easy choses random moves
- Medium has a few strategies built in, like:
  - Taking the center when going first
  - Prevents you from winning when you're 1 move away
  - Goes for the winning move when it's 1 move away
  - Has a move priority that goes Center->Sides->Edges
- Hard always chooses the best possible move using the minimax algorithm.
